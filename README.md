# SUGGESTIONS

1. Gulp file only provides the basic flow, you are free to add as many tasks(sequence of tasks) as you need for a smooth development process;
2. The endpoints (on apiary-mock) contains mock data and, even though PUT and POST requests are allowed you will NOT change the actual data;
3. If, for any reason, you might get stuck, don't waste time, fell free to contact us for suggestions or ideas (we encourage and appreciate team work);
